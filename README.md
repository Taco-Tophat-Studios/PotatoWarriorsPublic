Public version of Potato Warriors, with secure files removed

- Global.cs was deleted due to various methods relating to the encryption and decryption of IP addresses.
- Every line that mentioned it was commented out, so there are no compilation errors. However, the project will not run because of it.
- In addition, this is a snapshot of the game in progress, to provide a view of my development process. Any errors or possible improvements 
  are likely adressed or to be adressed soon upon viewing.
