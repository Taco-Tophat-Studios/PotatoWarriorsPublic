Public version of Potato Warriors

Currently, the game is *playable*, but only barely so, and there are many bugs and improvements to be made for Repo build 4.

TO TEST:

1. Download Godot Version 4.3 with .Net c# support (https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)
2. Download the .Net SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
3. Open the Godot Launcher, import the project files
4. Press the "play" button on the top right
